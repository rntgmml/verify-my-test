## Important

To mimic form validation, I applied the following rules:

* Full name needs to have at least two names.

* Email should be in correct format.

* Mobile number should not be empty.

* Password should have at least 4 characters.

* Checkbox needs to be checked.

- The save button will only be enable if all the input validations pass.

- You can follow the validation steps from the progres component in the top right corner.
